To configure the PiCamera and Tesseract for optimal text recognition with 8MP images on a Raspberry Pi, ensure you capture high-quality images by adjusting the camera settings, such as resolution and exposure. Preprocess the images using techniques like grayscale conversion and thresholding before passing them to Tesseract for improved OCR accuracy. ### Configuration Steps for PiCamera and Tesseract

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed on your Raspberry Pi:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-picamera2
     sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
     pip3 install pytesseract
     pip3 install numpy
     sudo apt install python3-opencv
     ```

2. **Set Up the Camera**:
   - Initialize the PiCamera with appropriate settings for capturing 8MP images:
     ```python
     from picamera2 import Picamera2

     picam2 = Picamera2()
     picam2.configure(picam2.create_preview_configuration(main={"format": 'XRGB8888', "size": (1920, 1080)}))  # 8MP resolution
     picam2.start()
     ```

3. **Capture Images**:
   - Capture images using the camera and save them for processing:
     ```python
     import time

     time.sleep(2)  # Allow the camera to adjust
     image = picam2.capture_array()  # Capture the image
     ```

4. **Preprocess the Image**:
   - Convert the image to grayscale and apply denoising algorithm of FastNlMeansDenoising to enhance text visibility:
     ```python
     import cv2
     import numpy as np

             image_cv = cv2.cvtColor(np.array(image), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image_cv, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  # Direct grayscale conversion

        # Apply Non-Local Means Denoising (preserves edges better than Gaussian)
        denoised = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(
            gray, 
            h=denoise_strength,      # Adjust based on noise level (higher = stronger denoising)
            templateWindowSize=7, 
            searchWindowSize=21
        )

        # Ensure black text on white background (critical for Tesseract)
        if np.mean(denoised) < 127:
            denoised = cv2.bitwise_not(denoised)

        # Save denoised image for inspection
        if debug:
            cv2.imwrite("debug_denoised.png", denoised)
     ```

5. **Perform OCR with Tesseract**:
   - Use Tesseract to extract text from the preprocessed image:
     ```python
     import pytesseract

     custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6'  # Use the default OCR Engine Mode and Page Segmentation Mode
     text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, config=custom_config)
     print(text)
     ```

6. **Optimize Image Quality**:
   - Ensure good lighting conditions and focus when capturing images. Adjust camera settings like exposure and ISO if necessary to reduce noise and improve clarity.

7. **Post-Processing**:
   - After obtaining the text, consider applying additional filtering to clean up the output, such as removing non-alphanumeric characters:
     ```python
     text = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, text))  # Keep only alphanumeric characters
     ```
